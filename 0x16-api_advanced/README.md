This project involves creating Python scripts that interact with the Reddit API to query and process subreddit data. The tasks include:

Number of Subscribers: A function to return the total number of subscribers for a given subreddit.
Top Ten Posts: A function to print the titles of the first 10 hot posts for a given subreddit.
Recursive Hot Posts: A recursive function to return a list of titles for all hot articles in a subreddit.
Keyword Count: A recursive function to count and print occurrences of specified keywords in hot article titles.
All tasks are implemented using Python 3 and the Requests module, following PEP 8 style guidelines.
